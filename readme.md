# Example Sheet Tracker

A program to track progress through example sheets.

## How it works

A hierarchy of terms, courses, sheets and questions are stored in an XML file that is read by the program. The user is then able to navigate through this heirarchy, and is provided with infomration about progress through example sheets.

## To do for next version (v1.1)

### Get an icon

Currently the application does not have an icon for the taskbar. It needs to be approximately 64x64 and in ICO format.

### Updates to progress display for courses

Currently, if there is no active sheet an "on schedule" is displayed. It would be nice if this could just be blank.

### Better file selection

Currently the system uses a file named `Data.xml` that is in the same directory as the executable. It is desirable for this to be able to be chosen by the user in the case this file is not found.

## To do for a later version
### Timer system

A larger addition to the project would be to allow the user to select the question they are currently on, and then the program will time how long  they are spending on each question.
